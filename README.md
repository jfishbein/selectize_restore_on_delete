# restore_on_delete ([selectize.js](https://github.com/selectize/selectize.js) plugin)

See the [Selectize Plugin Docs](https://github.com/brianreavis/selectize.js/blob/master/docs/plugins.md) for general use instructions.

This plugin allows you to press the [delete] key and edit the following item without it being fully removed. It is similar to the restore_on_backspace plugin, just for the delete key to make the user experience consistent.

  $('select').selectize({
    plugins: ['restore_on_delete']
  });
```
